## Description:

We want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

```ruby
seven(times(five)) # must return 35
four(plus(nine)) # must return 13
eight(minus(three)) # must return 5
six(divided_by(two)) # must return 3
```

### Requirements:

* There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
* There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy (divided_by in Ruby)
* Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
* The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
